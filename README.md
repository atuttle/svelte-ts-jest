# Svelte + TS + Jest

I wanted to use TDD to teach myself TypeScript and Svelte, but I ran into some problems. This repo illustrates the steps I've taken and the files I've modified. The commit history shows each step.

I'm planning to write a simple dice-game to have something more interesting than a ToDo list to work on. Let's call it `DiceWar`.

1. `npx degit sveltejs/template dicewar`
2. `node scripts/setupTypeScript.js`
